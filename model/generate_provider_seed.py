"""Generate a seed provider-routing dataset for the PrismSpace provider router.

Maps realistic prompts to the Hive provider best suited for each task type,
based on documented provider strengths (speed, context length, multimodal,
code, safety, privacy).  This is a bootstrap dataset — replace it with
measured production telemetry as soon as practical.

Usage:
    python -m model.generate_provider_seed --output-dir model/datasets/curated/provider
    python -m model.generate_provider_seed --samples-per-provider 200
    python -m model.generate_provider_seed --dry-run
